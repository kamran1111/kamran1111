- 👋 Hi, I’m @kamran1111 (name Kamran), a PhD scholar in Sustainability Science. I am currently residing in Japan. 
- 👀 I’m interested in geospatial data analytics (GIS, Big Data, satellite remote sensing) and visualization. It helps me uncover geospatial data's insights and patterns. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the "Data Scientist using Python" track from DataCamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to undertake a data science internship to solidify my learning through real-world application. Particularly, aspiring to work with organizations working in the field of climate change, environmental science, or other sustainable development-related themes.
