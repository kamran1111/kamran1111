- 👋 Hi, I’m @kamran1111 (name Kamran), a PhD scholar in the field of Sustainability Science. I am currently residing in Japan. 
- 👀 I’m interested in geospatial data analytics (GIS, Big Data, satellite remote sensing) and visualization. It helps me uncover the spatial and temporal insights and patterns in geospatial data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "Data Scientist using Python" track from DataCamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to undertake practical opportunities such as internship to practice data science using Python. Particularly, willing to work with organizations working in the field of climate change, environmental science, or other sustanable development related themes.
